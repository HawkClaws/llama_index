# LlamaIndex Retrievers Integration: MongoDBAtlasBM25Retriever

## What is this?

This is a BM25 Retriever for MongoDB Atlas that can be used with LlamaIndex.

It was created using llamaindex 0.9.36, so you may need to adjust the llamaindex imports as needed.

## How to use

This was created with reference to [MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vector_stores/MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch.html), so it's mostly the same.

Please refer to that.

However, while `MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch` is an Index, `MongoDBAtlasBM25Retriever` is a Retriever.
